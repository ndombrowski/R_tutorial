The html of this tutorial can be found [here](https://ndombrowski.github.io/R_tutorial/)

Additionally, we provide some example input files and examples for output files generated by this workflow in two separate folders. Additionally, the raw rmd file is provided in case you want to have a look at the R code.

In brief this tutorial provides

- A brief introduction into R, RStudio and RMarkdown files
- An introduction into R terminology (vectors, matrices, dataframes, ...)
- Installing new packages
- Using basic R operations
- A basic stats introduction (please note that the author is no statistician ;-) )
- Basic Plotting in R
- Using ggplot2 for generating plots
- Working with annotation data. This part is specific to some pipelines from the Spang team but might nevertheless be useful if you want to learn how to summarize large datatables.
